**I**t was a week ago I had come across Meteorjs . I had a glance into it about a year ago in [railscasts][1] but as I was totally into Rails I didn&#8217;t bother into looking into it.

After completion of my Rails project a facebook game , I had the chance to work on a prototype Meteor test project, the task was to use the API of Dropbox to fetch the account details and the Dropbox content of it into my application. We completed it in 4 days successfully.

I didn&#8217;t know that development in Meteorjs could be so awesome. I read its documentation and tried out the examples and then I was amazed at how it handles all the things and that too with ease and this makes the development faster. Most fascinating features is its **Live page updates** and the number of packages available for Meteor at [atmospherejs][2] .

I think its the **NEXT BIG THING **in the web technology . I will definitely keep posting about it as I work on it further.
