After completing my  2 years in the field of web technology, this is my first technical blog . I know this should had been done earlier , but as the saying goes *&#8220;better late then never&#8221;.  *

For the **introduction** part I am a Ruby on Rails developer based in India .When I started out in this adventure there were many hurdles that came through but  I always had the opportunity to work with **smart** people from whom I had learnt everything.

Whenever I had got struct in some issues there were many such blogs that would show the right path to solve the problem. So I had also decided that I will be sharing the knowledge that I gather from my surroundings and give my bit to the Open Source World.

So this is my journey so far , will share more along the cruise..
